Stuck with a severe case of writer's block? Have the setting you envisioned but paralyzed with too many options for continuing the story? Try [AI Storyteller](https://hollyyfc-aistoryteller.streamlit.app/)! Be it a poem, novel or creative essay, we've got your back to help you get over the hump. A little assistance can unleash a lot of creativity.

The web app itself is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and powered by [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilgpt2)'s `distilgpt2` model, an English-language model pre-trained with the supervision of the smallest version of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) for resource and response efficiency. The application invites users to kick-start a story with their own sentences, which the AI then elaborates on, spinning the tale further with imaginative continuity. The UI is crafted with a soothing Morandi color scheme, offering a visually pleasing and user-friendly environment for storytelling enthusiasts and casual users alike.
