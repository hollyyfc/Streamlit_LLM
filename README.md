# ‚ú® AI Storyteller 

***‚Äî‚Äî A Streamlit App Powered by HuggingFace LLM***

Stuck with a severe case of writer's block? Have the setting you envisioned but paralyzed with too many options for continuing the story? Try [AI Storyteller](https://hollyyfc-aistoryteller.streamlit.app/)! Be it a poem, novel or creative essay, we've got your back to help you get over the hump. A little assistance can unleash a lot of creativity.

The web app itself is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and powered by [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilgpt2)'s `distilgpt2` model, an English-language model pre-trained with the supervision of the smallest version of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) for resource and response efficiency. The application invites users to kick-start a story with their own sentences, which the AI then elaborates on, spinning the tale further with imaginative continuity. The UI is crafted with a soothing Morandi color scheme, offering a visually pleasing and user-friendly environment for storytelling enthusiasts and casual users alike.

*Note: Due to the size of your input and the model computing period, the response time might vary between 4 to 7 seconds. Beware of refresh or multiple hits of the button!*

## Reproducible Steps

If you're interested in replicating the app or building somehting of your own, Streamlit provides a user-friendly environment for production in Python: 

1. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
2. Install HuggingFace Transformers library: `pip install transformers`
3. Create a directory / folder hosting your project
4. Place `requirements.txt` in your directory. Add necessary library dependencies to the file. (Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if dependencies were never installed locally before)
5. Create a `<YOUR-APP-NAME>.py` file in your directory and build your app with Python. Feel free to refer to my code and take a look at the Streamlit UI structure and how to utilize imported LLMs
6. Local run and test your app: `streamlit run <YOUR-APP-NAME>.py` 
7. Create a GitHub repo and push both files there
8. Deploy your app on Streamlit: 
    - Go to https://streamlit.io/ and signup for an account (ideally using your GitHub account)
    - Navigate to your profile and create a new app *using existing repository*
    - Choose the GitHub repo you wish to connect and import your files, and correctly fill in the required fields
    - Wait for deployment 

You should get an URL for your final deployed app (either system-generated or self-defined). Make sure to check your developer logs for any deployment issues!
